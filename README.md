K-Board is a project management web application that allows users to visually organize project tasks. It is a Kanban-style list-making web application similar to solutions like Trello or Jira. K-board was implmented in a three-tier architechtire model for better development flexibility. <br />

Users can create boards for projects and create lists based on the project needs and delete once a task has reached completion. K-Board comes with a simple UI that makes it easy for a user to manage boards and lists.
